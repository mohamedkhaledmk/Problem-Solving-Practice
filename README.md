# Problem Solving Practice – ITI Journey 🚀

This repository documents my **daily problem-solving practice** throughout my **9-month ITI scholarship**.  
I created it as a **personal challenge** to consistently improve my problem-solving skills and to track my progress over time.

The goal is not only to solve problems, but to **think better**, explore **different approaches**, and build a stronger problem-solving mindset by the end of the scholarship.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

- Improve my **problem-solving skills** through daily practice
- Track progress over a **long-term learning journey**
- Explore **multiple solutions** for the same problem when possible
- Build the habit of **thinking from different angles**
- Share knowledge that may help others in the future

## 🧠 Why Multiple Solutions Matter

During my learning journey, I realized that looking at **different solutions for the same problem** can be incredibly powerful.  
It helps in:
- Understanding the problem more deeply
- Learning new techniques and patterns
- Improving logical thinking and efficiency

That’s one of the main reasons I decided to make this repository public.
